        <p>People celebrate Earth Day on April 22 each year to show their support for environmental protection. Since the first Earth Day
            was observed in 1970, millions of people have come together to promote environmental issues and encourage action, making it a
            genuinely global phenomenon. The purpose of Earth Day is to raise public awareness of how human activity affects the environment
            and to inspire individuals and groups to take action to protect it. The day serves as a reminder that everyone has a responsibility
            to protect the environment and that we must work together to find solutions to the issues we are now facing. </p>

        <p>To commemorate the day, events are frequently planned that include planting trees, picking up trash, and taking part in environmental
            education initiatives.

        <p>Since Earth Day helps to increase awareness of the value of preserving the environment, it has had a considerable impact on international
            environmental policy. Important environmental laws including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act were all made
            possible because to it.</p>
