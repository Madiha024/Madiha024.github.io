        <p>Every year on April 22, people around the world observe Earth Day to show their support for environmental preservation.
            Since the inaugural Earth Day was marked in 1970, millions of people have joined forces to raise awareness of and take action
            on environmental issues, making it is a truly global phenomenon. </p>

        <p>The goal of Earth Day is to increase public awareness of the effects of human activity on the environment and to motivate people and communities to take action to safeguard it.
            The day serves as a reminder that we all have a duty to save the planet, and that we must cooperate to find answers to the environmental problems we currently face. </p>

        <p>Activities such as planting trees, cleaning up litter, and participating in environmental education programs are often organized to mark the day.</p>

        <p>Earth Day has had a significant impact on global environmental policy, as it has helped to raise awareness about the importance of protecting
            the planet. It has also been instrumental in the creation of important environmental legislation such as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and
            the Endangered Species Act.</p>
