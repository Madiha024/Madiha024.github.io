        <h2 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">What is Chinese New Year and how is it celebrated?</h2>
        <p>The most significant traditional festival in China is Chinese New Year, which is sometimes referred to as the Spring Festival.
            It is observed on the first day of the lunar calendar, which typically falls between late January and mid-February.
            Several nations with sizable Chinese populations, such Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam, also widely observe the event.</p>

        <p>Chinese New Year is generally celebrated for 15 days, beginning with a feast on New Year's Eve and ending with the Lantern Festival.
            Families get together, exchange gifts, and take part in a variety of traditional activities during this time to pay respect to their
            ancestors and to pray for luck, happiness, and success in the next year.</p>

        <p>The cleaning and decorating of homes during Chinese New Year is one of the most significant customs. Before the New Year, many people
            believe that cleaning their homes will help to remove any bad luck from the past year and make room for good fortune in the next year.
            As red is thought to bring prosperity and fortune, they often decorate their homes with red lanterns, banners, and papercuts.</p>

        <p>The reunion supper on New Year's Eve is a significant part of the Chinese New Year celebration. Families join together to have a
            substantial meal that frequently includes foods with symbolic significance. For instance, fish is a symbol of prosperity and abundance,
            while dumplings are a lucky food.</p>

        <p>People also go to temples during the course of the 15-day festival and offer prayers for prosperity, wellness, and happiness. They are
            allowed to make offerings to the gods and ancestors and burn incense and candles.</p>

        <p>The Lantern Festival, which concludes the Chinese New Year celebration, is marked by fireworks displays, lion dances, and colorful lanterns.
            Additionally, sweet glutinous rice dumplings are consumed; they are thought to bring families luck and harmony.</p>
