            <h1>What is Eid-al-Adha?</h1>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p> Eid-al-Adha is the festival of sacrifice. Eid-al-Adhaa is the tenth day of Dhul-Hijjah, the last (twelfth) month of the Hijri
                    or Islamic calendar. It is, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “The greatest day in the sight of Allaah, may He be blessed
                    and exalted, the Day of Sacrifice . . .” (Reported by Abu Dawud). It has the same etiquettes as the Eid-ul-Fitr prayer and 
                    traditionally begins the day after the sighting of the new crescent moon.</p>
                    <p>The reason why it is described as the greatest day of the year is that it combines so many acts of worship which are not combined
                        on any other day, such as the Eid prayer, offering the sacrifice, reciting Takbeer (glorifying Allaah), and widespread remembrance
                        of Allaah. For the pilgrims in Makkah, it also includes offering a sacrifice, stoning the pillars representing Shaytaan (the devil),
                        shaving the head (for men only; women merely cut a little off their hair), and performing Tawaaf (circumambulation of the Ka‘bah)
                        and Sa‘ee (running between the two hills of Safaa and Marwa). </p>

                        <h2>Why is Eid-al-Adha celebrated?</h2>
                        <p>It honours the willingness of Ibrahim (PBUH) to sacrifice his son Ismail (PBUH) as an act of obedience to God's command.
                            Before Ibrahim (PBUH) could sacrifice his son, however, Allah provided a lamb to sacrifice instead. The festival remembers the Prophet
                            Ibrahim's (PBUH) willingness to sacrifice his son when God ordered him to.</p>
