            <h1>What is Eid-al-Adha?</h1>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>The sacrificial holiday is known as Eid al-Adha. Eid-al-Adha is observed on the tenth day of Dhul-Hijjah, the last (twelfth) month,
                    according to the Hijri or Islamic calendar. It usually begins the day after the new crescent moon is sighted and follows the same
                    procedure as the Eid-ul-Fitr prayer.</p>
                    <p>The Eid prayer, the sacrifice, the recital of the Takbeer, and widespread remembrance of Allah are just a few of the acts of worship
                        that are united on this day, which is why it is known as the greatest day of the year. Making a sacrifice, stoning the Shaytaan(the devil)
                        pillars, shaving one's head (men only; women only trim a small portion of their hair), performing the Tawaaf (circumambulation of the Ka'bah),
                        and performing the Sa'ee, i.e, running between the two hills of Safaa and Marwa, are additional requirements for pilgrims in Makkah.</p>

                        <h2>Why is Eid-al-Adha celebrated?</h2>
                        <p>It honors Ibrahim's (PBUH) willingness to offer his son Ismail (PBUH) as a sacrifice in response to God's instruction.
                            However, before Ibrahim (PBUH) could offer his son, Allah sent a lamb in its place. The celebration honors the Prophet Ibrahim's (PBUH)
                            readiness to offer his son as a sacrifice when God commanded him to.</p>
