        <p>A small town in Somerset, England called Glastonbury has gained worldwide recognition for its yearly music event. One of the biggest and
            most well-known music events in the world, the festival, formally known as the Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts,
            draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.</p>

        <p>The town of Glastonbury is thought to have been a place of religious importance for thousands of years, so its history can be traced back to
            prehistoric times. It is home to the famous Glastonbury Tor, a hill that rises dramatically from the surrounding landscape, and is rumored
            to be the location of the fabled Isle of Avalon, where King Arthur was buried.</p>

        <p>This small village has become well-known thanks to the Glastonbury Festival. A group of friends started the event in 1970 by hosting a music
            festival on a farm close to the town. The festival began as a single-day affair but rapidly gained popularity and drew some of the biggest
            musical stars.</p>

        <p>The Glastonbury Festival now takes place over several days, has multiple stages, and includes hundreds of acts.
            The festival has hosted a wide variety of performers over the years, from contemporary pop stars like Beyonc√© and Adele to rock icons like
            The Rolling Stones and David Bowie. </p>
