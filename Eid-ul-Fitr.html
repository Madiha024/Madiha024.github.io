            <h1>What is Eid-ul-Fitr?</h1>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>Eid-ul-Fitr is celebrated by Muslims worldwide because it marks the end of the month-long dawn-to-sunset fasting of Ramadan.
                    It traditionally begins the day after the sighting of the new crescent moon. If not, Muslims continue their fast for one more 
                    day until the moon is sighted. It is celebrated during the first three days of Shawwal (10th month of Islamic calendar after the month of Ramadan).
                    Takbeer: Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, wa Lillaahi’l-hamd (Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great,
                    there is no god except Allaah, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, and all praise be to Allaah) is recited before Eid prayer.
                </p>
                <h2>Etiquettes of Eid:</h2>
                <h3>1. Doing ghusl (taking shower) before going out to the prayer</h3>
                <h3>2. Eating dates before going out to pray on Eid al-Fitr</h3>
                <p>Part of the etiquette is not to go out to pray on Eid al-Fitr until one has eaten some dates, because of the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari
                    from Anas ibn Maalik, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used not to go out on the morning of
                    Eid al-Fitr until he had eaten some dates… of which he would eat an odd number.(Al-Bukhaari, 953)</p>
                <h3>3. Takbeer on the day of Eid</h3>
                <p>Both men and women should recite takbeer on the day of Eid before the Eid prayer. This is one of the greatest
                    Sunnahs(traditions and practices of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) who is a model for Muslims to follow) on the day of Eid.</p>
                <h3>4. Offering Congratulations</h3>
                <p>The etiquette of Eid also includes the congratulations and good wishes exchanged by people, no matter what the wording, such as saying to one another
                Taqabbala Allaah minna wa minkum (May Allaah accept (good deeds) from us and from you” or “Eid mubaarak”) and other permissible expressions of congratulations.</p>
                <p>It was narrated that Jubayr ibn Nufayr said: When the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) met one another on the day of Eid, they
                    would say to one another, “May Allaah accept (good deeds) from us and from you.” Ibn Hajar said, its isnaad is hasan. (Al-Fath, 2/446)</p>
                <h3>5. Adorning oneself on the occasion of Eid</h3>
                <p>Everyone should wear the best clothes they have for Eid prayer.</p>
                <h3>6. Going to the prayer by one route and returning by another.</h3>
                <p>It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: On the day of Eid, the Prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to vary his route.
                    It was said that the reason for that was so that the two routes would testify for him on the Day of Resurrection, for the earth will speak on the Day of Resurrection and say what was done on it,
                    both good and bad. It was also in order to attend to the people’s needs, to answer their questions, teach them, set an example and give charity to the needy, or to visit his relatives and uphold
                    the ties of kinship.
