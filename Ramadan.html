                <h1>Fasting in the month of Ramadan</h1>
                <p>Fasting means abstaining from things which break the fast, such as food, drink and intercourse, from the break of true dawn until sunset, with the intention of fasting.
                    The relationship of patience to faith is like that of the head to the body. Allah has enjoined upon this ummah fasting for one month of the year, in order to draw closer
                    to Allah, to avoid that which Allah has forbidden, to get used to being patient, to bring the nafs (self) under control, to compete in generosity and to demonstrate cooperation
                    and mutual compassion. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
                    “O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious).” [al-Baqarah 2:183]</p>
                    <h3 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">What are the virtues of Ramadan?</h3>
                    <p>The month of Ramadan is a great month, in which Allah revealed the Quran. The reward for good deeds, acts of charity and acts of worship are multiplied in this month. In it is Laylat al-Qadr,
                        which is better than a thousand months. Because it is the night in which the prophet Mohammed received the first revelation from God. The Night of Power is one of the odd-numbered nights of the
                        last ten days of Ramadan. A portion of this night is spent reading the Qur'an and making special prayers.
                        Also, during the month of Ramadan, the gates of Heaven are opened and the gates of Hell are shut, and the shayateen (devils) are tied up.</p>
                        <h3 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">Who must fast in Ramadan?</h3>
                        <p>Allah has made fasting the month of Ramadan obligatory upon every sane, adult Muslim, male and female alike, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
                        <p>“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights
                            (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number
                            [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days. Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you. (He wants that you) must
                            complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him.” [al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
                            <p>There is a great reward with Allaah for fasting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every action of the son of Adam is multiplied, each good deed  receiving a tenfold to seven hundredfold
                            reward. Allah said, ‘Except for fasting, for it is done for Me and I will give a reward for it, for he gives up his desire and food for My sake.’”</p>
                        <h3 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">What do Muslims do during the month of Ramadan?</h3>
                        <p>Muslims wake up to do suhoor/ sehri/ sehar. Which means they wake up to eat before Dawn during Ramadan, after which they fast until after
                            sunset. They eat until they hear adhaan(Islamic call to prayer(salah) in a mosque recited by a muezzin at prescribed times of the day).
                        </p>
                        <p>After sunset, Muslims do iftaar (break their fast). It is sunnah(traditions and practices of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) who is a model for Muslims to follow) to hasten to break one's
                            fast. What one should do is to hasten to break the fast with dates or dried dates, or with water, if dates are not available. They should eat small morsels that will calm one’s hunger,
                            then get up to pray Maghrib, then if one wishes, one may come back and eat more.
                            This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to
                            break his fast before praying by eating fresh dates, and if there were no fresh dates he would eat dried dates; if there were no dried dates, he would have a few sips of water.”
                            (al-Sawm, 632; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 560)

                        </p>
                        <p>After the Maghrib prayer, Muslims prepare themselves for a special prayer called Tarawih/Taraweeh which involves reading long portions of the Quran. The Imaam(person who leads the prayer)
                            has to finish reading Quran during the month of Ramadan. If they finish early, they restart reading. For example, if according to the Islamic calendar, if Eid al-fitr falls the next day after the 30th day of Ramadan,
                            but if there was no sighting of the new crescent moon, then Muslims continue to go pray Tarawih/Taraweeh for one more day and the Imam restarts reading the Quran.
