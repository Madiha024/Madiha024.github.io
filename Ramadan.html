                <h1>Fasting in the month of Ramadan</h1>
                <p>In order to fast, one must refrain from eating or drinking anything between the genuine break of morning and sundown. It's a
                    wonderful month since Allah revealed the Qur'an during it, and the rewards for good deeds, charitable acts, and acts of worship
                    are multiplied. The Night of Power, one of the final 10 days of Ramadan's odd-numbered nights, is when Muslims read the Qur'an and
                    offer special prayers. The portals of Heaven are opened, the gates of Hell are closed, and the shayateen (devils) are bound during
                    the month of Ramadan. Every sane, mature Muslim, male and female, is required to fast by Allah. Therefore, everyone who sees the crescent
                    on the first night of the month must observe Sawm (fasts) that month, and if they are ill or traveling, they must make up the missed
                    Sawm days with other days. Every deed committed by a son of Adam is multiplied, according to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah
                    be upon him), with rewards ranging from tenfold to seven hundredfold.</p>

                    <p>Muslims observe suhoor, sehri, sehar, iftaar, and fast till after sundown during Ramadan. (break their fast). If dates are
                        unavailable, it is sunnah to quickly break one's fast with dry dates or water. Muslims get ready for the Tarawih/Taraweeh
                        prayer, which entails reading extensive passages of the Quran, after the Maghrib prayer. If Eid al-Fitr falls the day
                        following the 30th day of Ramadan and they finish early, they pick up reading again.</p>
