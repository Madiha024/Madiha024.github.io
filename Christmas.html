        <p>One of the most cherished holidays observed worldwide is Christmas. Every year on December 25, people celebrate the birth of
            Jesus Christ in accordance with Christian tradition. Christmas is essentially a religious festival, but it has also evolved
            into a secular occasion that unites people from many religions and origins in an atmosphere of joy, generosity, and kindness.</p>

        <p>Different nations have different Christmas customs, but some are universal, such as putting up Christmas trees, lights, and ornaments in
            private residences and public places. Mistletoe is sometimes hung, and individuals give and receive gifts from family and friends.
            Children frequently take part in pageants or plays that tell the Nativity narrative, and many villages host carolers and other musical
            performances.</p>

        <p>Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas or Saint Nicholas in some regions of the world, is one of the most well-known Christmas symbols.
            On Christmas Eve, Santa Claus is said to go in a sleigh drawn by reindeer and enter houses through chimneys to deliver gifts to children
            all over the world. Children frequently send letters to Santa Claus requesting gifts based on their good behavior.</p>
