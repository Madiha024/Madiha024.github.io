        <p>Martin Luther King Jr., one of the important protagonists in the 20th-century civil rights movement, is remembered and honored
            on Martin Luther King Day, a federal holiday in the US. This day has been set aside so that people of all racial and ethnic
            backgrounds can join together and pay tribute to a man who spent his whole life battling for justice, equality, and human 
            rights. This day is observed on the third Monday of JanuaryOn April 4, 1968, King was slain in Memphis, Tennessee, shocking
            the country and sparking a wave of protests and upheaval. A proposal to designate January 21 as a federal holiday was made in
            the U.S. Congress in 1983, however some lawmakers voted against it.
        </p>

        <p>President Ronald Reagan finally signed the measure into law in 1986 after years of protesting by civil rights organizations
            and those who wished to preserve King's legacy. Numerous towns and groups hold marches, parades, and charitable projects on
            this day to pay tribute to King's legacy and his ongoing efforts to build a more just and equal society.
