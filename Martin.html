        <p>In the United States, Martin Luther King Day is a federal holiday that is observed every third Monday in January.
            It is a day set aside to celebrate and remember the life and contributions of Martin Luther King Jr., one of the most important figures in the 20th-century civil rights movement. </p>

        <p>In Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929, Martin Luther King Jr. was born.
            He then became a Baptist minister and a civil rights leader, becoming well-known for his support of nonviolent protest and his stirring lectures that motivated millions of people to take up the cause of racial equality. </p>

        <p>King was crucial to several crucial civil rights movement moments, including the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, and the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955.
            For his efforts to use nonviolent tactics to remove racial segregation and advance racial equality, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. </p>

        <p>On April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, King was slain after years of directing the civil rights movement.
            His passing stunned the country and triggered protracted rioting and protests all over the place. </p>

        <p>A bill to create Martin Luther King Day a federal holiday was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 1983, but it was opposed by certain representatives who felt King wasn't important enough to warrant a holiday.
            The statute recognizing the third Monday in January as Martin Luther King Day was not signed into law by President Ronald Reagan until 1986, after years of lobbying by civil rights organizations and advocates of King's legacy. </p>

        <p>Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a time for contemplation, remembering the man, and honoring his dream of a more just and equal society.
            It is a day set aside for people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds to gather together and pay tribute to a man who gave his entire life to the pursuit of justice, equality, and human rights.
            To celebrate King's legacy and his ongoing efforts to create a more just and equitable society, numerous towns and groups organize marches, parades, and service initiatives on this day. </p>
