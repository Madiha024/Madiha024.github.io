        <p>Mardi Gras is an annual carnival festival that takes place in numerous locations throughout the world, most notably in New Orleans,
            Louisiana. It is held on the day before Ash Wednesday, which ushers in the Christian season of Lent. The tradition of feasting and
            celebrating before the Lenten season was widespread throughout medieval Europe, and was brought to Louisiana by French settlers in
            the 17th and 18th centuries. Mardi Gras festivities in New Orleans are renowned for their grandiose parades, vibrant costumes, and
            exciting street parties. The King Cake, a delectable cake with a tiny plastic baby baked inside, is a tradition that is believed to
            be lucky for the upcoming year. People also dress up in elaborate costumes and masks to exhibit their creativity and have fun before
            the more solemn season of Lent begins.</p>
