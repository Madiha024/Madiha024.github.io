        <h2 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">What is Mardi Gras and how is it celebrated?</h2>
        <p>Mardi Gras is an annual carnival festival that takes place in numerous locations throughout the world, most notably in New Orleans, Louisiana.
            It is also known as "Fat Tuesday" in English. The ceremony is held on the day before Ash Wednesday, which ushers in the Christian season of Lent.</p>

        <p>Before the solemnity of Lent begins, individuals can indulge in food, wine, and fun during Mardi Gras. The tradition of feasting and celebrating before
            the Lenten season was widespread throughout medieval Europe, which is where Mardi Gras got its start. In the 17th and 18th centuries, French settlers
            came to Louisiana and brought with them their own Mardi Gras customs.</p>

        <p>Mardi Gras festivities in New Orleans are renowned for their grandiose parades, vibrant costumes, and exciting street parties. In addition to marching bands,
            dancing groups, and other entertainers, the parades include floats that are embellished with beads, vivid colors, and other decorations. The performers
            aboard the floats get beads and other gifts from spectators.</p>

        <p>The King Cake, a delectable cake with a tiny plastic baby baked inside, is one of the many activities and traditions that Mardi Gras in New Orleans includes
            in addition to the parades. It is believed that whomever finds the baby in their slice of cake will be lucky for the upcoming year.</p>

        <p>At Mardi Gras, individuals also dress up in elaborate costumes and masks, frequently in vivid colors.
            Before the more solemn season of Lent gets started, people can exhibit their creativity and have fun by dressing up. </p>
