                </section>

                <section>
                    <p>
                        Makara Sankranti is celebrated in various parts of the Indian subcontinent to observe the day which marks the shift
                        of the sun into ever-lengthening days. The festival is a seasonal observance as well as a religious celebration.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Makar Sankranti, the festival is predominantly a harvest festival and is celebrated throughout India, from north to south
                        and east to west. While Makar Sankranti is most popular in West India, down south, the festival is known as Pongal and in the
                        north, it is celebrated as Lohri. Uttarayan, Maghi, Khichdi are some other names of the same festival. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Makar Sankranti is the festival of til-gul where sesame and jaggery laddoos or chikkis are distributed among all.
                        Makar Sankranti is believed to be a time for peace and prosperity. The day is regarded as important for spiritual practices and
                        accordingly people take a holy dip in rivers, especially Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery. The bathing is believed to
                        wash away sins. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is Lohri?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Lohri marks the beginning of the end of winter, coming of spring and the new year. The festival is traditionally associated with the
                        harvest of the rabi crops. The traditional time to harvest sugarcane crops is January, therefore, Lohri is seen by some to be a harvest
                        festival. And thus, Punjabi farmers see the day after Lohri (Maghi) as the financial New Year.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lohri is essentially a festival dedicated to fire and the sun god. It is the time when the sun transits the zodiac sign Makar (Capricorn),
                        and moves towards the north. Gur rewri, peanuts and popcorns are the three munchies associated with this festival. Besides these, in Punjab
                        villages, it is a tradition to eat gajjak, sarson da saag and makki di roti on the day of Lohri. It is also traditional to eat 'til rice
                        --sweet rice made with jaggery (gur) and sesame seeds.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is Thai Pongal?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Thai is the first month of the Tamil Almanac, and Pongal is a dish of sweet concoction of rice, moong dal, jaggery and milk. This festival
                        is celebrated by one and all as it is non-relevance to any particular religious faith. The whole Tamil population of the world celebrate it
                        without any differences. Therefore it is widely known as "Tamil Thai Pongal" or the "Festival of the Tamils". It is celebrated on the first
                        day of the month Thai of the Tamil calendar. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The festival is a thanks giving ceremony in which the farmers celebrate the event to thank the spirits of nature spirit, the Sun and the farm
                        animals for their assistance in providing a successful harvest. The rest of the people celebrate the festival to pay their thanks to the farmers
                        for the production of food. Overall, it is a festival to encourage social cohesiveness and unite people by bringing them together in a common
                        function.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On Thai Pongal, the family begins the day early. The traditional Pongal (rice pudding) is prepared in the front garden which is pre-prepared for
                        this ceremonious cooking. A flat square pitch is made and decorated with kolam drawings, and it is exposed to the direct sun light. A fire wood
                        hearth will be set up using three bricks. The cooking begins by putting a clay pot with water on the hearth. A senior member of the family conducts
                        the cooking and the rest of the family assists him or her or watches the event. When the water has boiled the rice is put into the pot - after a member
                        the family ceremoniously puts three handful of rice in first. The other ingredients of this special dish are chakkarai (brown cane sugar) or katkandu
                        (sugar candy), milk (cow's milk or coconut milk), roasted green gram (payaru), raisins, cashew nuts and few pods of cardamom. When the meal is ready it is
                        first put on a banana leaf and the family pray for few minutes to thank the nature sprit, the sun and farmers.
