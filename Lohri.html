                </section>

                        Various regions of the Indian subcontinent observe Makar Sankranti to mark the sun's transition into ever-lengthening days.
                        India celebrates this harvest festival from north to south and from east to west. The festival of til-gul, also known as Pongal
                        and Lohri, is when sesame and jaggery laddoos or chikkis are given out to everyone. People bathe in rivers to atone for their
                        sins because it is thought to be a time of peace and prosperity.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is Lohri?</h2>

                    <p>
                        It is customary to associate the Lohri festival, which commemorates both the sun and the fire god, with the rabi crop harvest.
                        It is the time when the sun passes through the Capricorn (Makar) zodiac sign as it moves northward. On the day of Lohri, it is usual
                        in Punjabi villages to eat gajjak, sarson da saag, and makki di roti. The three foods associated with this celebration are popcorn,
                        peanuts, and gur rewri. In addition, "til" rice, a sweet dish sweetened with jaggery (gur) and sesame seeds, is customary.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is Thai Pongal?</h2>

                    <p>
                        The Tamil population of the world celebrates Thai Pongal, also referred to as the "Festival of the Tamils" or "Tamil Thai Pongal." It is
                        observed on the first day of the Tamil calendar's month Thai and is a ceremony of thanksgiving for the Sun, the farm animals, and the
                        natural spirits who helped produce a good harvest. In the front garden, three bricks are used to build a fire wood hearth and bake the
                        traditional Pongal (rice pudding). A senior family member starts the cooking by placing a clay pot filled with water on the hearth. The
                        rest of the family participates in the activity or simply watches. Along with milk (cow's milk or coconut milk), roasted green gram
                        (payaru), raisins, cashew nuts, and a few cardamom pods, this specific treat also adds chakkarai (brown cane sugar) or katkandu 
                        (sugar candy), as well as other ingredients.
                        The family says a brief prayer to thank nature, the sun, and the farmers before serving the meal on a banana leaf.
