        <p>Easter is a season of joy, introspection, and rebirth. It's a time to spend time with loved ones, take part in springtime customs,
            and be grateful for the blessing of new life that the season brings.</p>

        <p>Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. It is celebrated on the first
            Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox, which typically falls between March 22 and April 25.</p>

        <p>Easter is a secular celebration with religious overtones. Easter is a moment for Christians to consider Jesus' suffering and to
            rejoice in his resurrection. On Easter Sunday, many Christians attend church services where they perform hymns and listen to sermons
            about the significance of the holiday. Before the major Easter celebration, some cultures observe a period of fasting and repentance.</p>

        <p>Easter eggs, bunnies, and chicks are common symbols used in secular Easter festivities. Since ancient times, springtime celebrations have
            been linked with the egg, an archaic symbol of new life. Children look for hidden eggs during Easter egg hunts, which are a worldwide
            tradition. Also typical Easter presents include chocolate eggs and other sweets.</p>

        <p>The Easter rabbit, which joined the celebration more recently, probably originated in Germany in the 16th century. According to legend,
            the Easter bunny would hide colored eggs for good kids to discover. The Easter bunny's role as a bringer of presents and treats for kids
            has increased over time.</p>

        <p>In some countries, Easter is a public holiday and schools and businesses are closed. In the United States, Easter Monday is not a federal holiday,
            but it is observed in some states.</p>
