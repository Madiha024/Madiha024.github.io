        <p>Every year on the final Monday in May, the United States celebrates Memorial Day as a federal holiday.
            The purpose of the day is to honor and remember the men and women who lost their lives while serving in the U.S. armed forces.
            It is a solemn day of reflection that gives people in America a chance to consider the sacrifices made by those who have fought to defend their nation and uphold their freedoms. .</p>

        <p>Memorial Day was first observed to honor the Union soldiers who lost their lives in the American Civil War.
            Formerly referred to as Decoration Day, it was observed by placing flowers and flags on the graves of dead troops.
            Later, the commemoration of all military men who lost their lives in the line of duty was added. </p>

        <p>Today, memorial services, parades, and other activities mark Memorial Day across the country.
            To pay homage to the deceased, many people visit cemeteries and military memorials.
            The American flag is displayed until noon, when it is raised to full staff as a representation of tenacity and optimism. </p>
