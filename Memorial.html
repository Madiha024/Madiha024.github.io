        <p>Memorial Day is a federal holiday in the United States and is observed every year on the last Monday in May. The aim of the day is
            to remember and pay tribute to the men and women who passed away while serving in the American military services. Americans get the
            opportunity to reflect on the sacrifices made by those who have fought to defend their country and uphold their freedoms on this
            sad day of remembrance.
        </p>

        <p>To remember the Union soldiers who died in the American Civil War, Memorial Day was first observed. Previously known as Decoration
            Day, it was marked by decorating the graves of fallen soldiers with flowers and flags. The remembering of all military veterans
            who died in the course of duty was later added.
        </p>

        <p>Memorial Day is celebrated nationwide today with memorial services, parades, and other events. Many people visit cemeteries and
            military memorials to offer respect to the deceased. The American flag is flown until noon, when it is lowered to half-staff
            as a symbol of perseverance and hope.
