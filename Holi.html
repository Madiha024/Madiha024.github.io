                        Holi is a one- to five-day long spring festivity. People are doused with colored powders and colors as bonfires are ignited.

                        Numerous tales are connected to this celebration. Hindus commemorate the death of Lord Krishna, a manifestation of God. Krishna
                        loved to play games and have fun when he was a kid. Krishna loved to splash each other with colored water together with his friends
                        and family.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Prahlada and Holika's tale is another Holi-related legend. Prahlada was saved by his aunt Holika, who is said to be immune to fire,
                        who was sitting on a campfire and holding Prahlada in her arms.
