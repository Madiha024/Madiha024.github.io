        <p>The largest beer jubilee in the world, known as Oktoberfest, takes place every time in Munich, Germany. It generally lasts for 16 days,
            from late September to the first weekend in October. Millions of people travel from each over the world to attend the jubilee to witness
            the beer, music, and cuisine of Bavaria. </p>

        <p>The jubilee is held at the Theresienwiese, a big public park in Munich. During the opening ceremony, the first beer keg is tapped, and the
            mayor of Munich exclaims,"O'zapft is!"( it's tapped!), It's tapped! "O'zapft is!" as a line of horse-drawn carriages passes by. At this point, the jubilee
            officially starts, and beer is handed without charge the entire time. </p>

        <p>In addition to beer, there are numerous other attractions at Oktoberfest, including recreation lifts, games, and traditional Bavarian food.
            The most popular dishes include roast chicken, sausages, pretzels, and a variety of afters. </p>

        <p>
            Numerous people dress in traditional Bavarian apparel, similar as dirndls and lederhosen, at Oktoberfest, a significant artistic jubilee
            in Germany. Several nations hold their own Oktoberfest fests, and the jubilee draws excursionists from each around the world. </p>
