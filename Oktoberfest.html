        <p>The largest beer festival in the world, known as Oktoberfest, takes place every year in Munich, Germany. It typically lasts for 16 days, from late September to the first weekend in October.
            Millions of people travel from all over the world to attend the festival to experience the beer, music, and cuisine of Bavaria. </p>

        <p>The Theresienwiese, a sizable public park in Munich, serves as the site of the event.
            The first keg of beer is tapped during the opening ceremony, and the mayor of Munich declares, "O'zapft is!" (it's tapped!) during a parade of horse-drawn carriages.
            The festival officially begins at this point, and beer is served freely the entire time. </p>

        <p>In addition to beer, there are many other attractions at Oktoberfest, including amusement rides, games, and traditional Bavarian food. The most
            popular dishes include roast chicken, sausages, pretzels, and a variety of pastries.</p>

        <p>Many people dress in traditional Bavarian attire, such as dirndls and lederhosen, at Oktoberfest, a significant cultural festival in Germany.
            Several nations hold their own Oktoberfest celebrations, and the festival draws tourists from all around the world. </p>
