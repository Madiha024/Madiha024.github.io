        <p>The first and second days of November each year in Mexico are observed as the Day of the Dead, or Da de Muertos in Spanish.
            Families and friends gather around this time to remember and flashback to their loved ones who have passed away.
            Throughout the pre-Columbian era, the Aztecs, Mayans, and other indigenous societies of Mexico held the views that dying was a
            natural part of life and that the souls of the dead persisted in the hereafter. To welcome the spirits of the deceased back to our
            world and grant them access to the things they enjoyed in life, families make stages, known as ofrendas, in their homes or at the graves
            of their loved ones. In addition to carnivals and processions, people dress up in colorful costumes and paint their faces to resemble
            skulls to commemorate the Day of the Dead. Tens of thousands of people gather in Mexico City for the most well-known festivals to
            commemorate the occasion. </p>
