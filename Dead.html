        <p>The Day of the Dead, also known as DÃ­a de Muertos in Spanish, is a traditional Mexican holiday that is celebrated on November 1st and
            2nd. It is a time when families and friends come together to honor and remember their loved ones who have passed away.</p>

        <p>The Aztecs, Mayans, and other indigenous civilizations in Mexico believed that death was a normal part of life and that the deceased continued to remain in the afterlife during pre-Columbian periods, which is when the Day of the Dead first appeared.
            They believed that their departed loved ones could return to see them at this time of year because they saw death as a passage from one state of being to another. </p>

        <p>Families build altars, known as ofrendas, in their homes or at the graves of their loved ones on the Day of the Dead.
            Flowers, candles, pictures, and food and drink offerings like pan de muerto (bread of the dead) and sugar skulls are used to decorate these altars.
            The purpose of the ofrendas is to welcome the spirits of the deceased back to our world and to provide them access to the things they loved in life. </p>

        <p>In addition to festivals and parades, the Day of the Dead is celebrated by dressing in vibrant costumes and applying skull-like face paint.
            The most well-known of these celebrations takes place in Mexico City, when tens of thousands of people come together to mark the occasion. </p>
