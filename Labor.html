        <p>The first Monday in September each year is designated as American Labor Day, a national holiday.
            The day celebrates the accomplishments and contributions of the American labor movement and the workers who have aided in the development and improvement of the nation.
            The significance of workers in American society is a topic worthy of thought as well as celebration. </p>

        <p>The American labor movement started to acquire momentum in the late 19th century, which is when Labor Day got its start.
            Many workers at the period had to deal with unpleasant working conditions, meager pay, and long hours.
            Labor unions were established to fight for improved working conditions, and they started planning protests and strikes to call for better treatment. </p>
        
        <h3 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">History</h3>
        <p>The Pullman Strike of 1894 was one of the most important occasions in the history of the labor movement in the United States.
            The American Railway Union's first president, Eugene V. Debs, oversaw the walkout, which involved over 250,000 workers across 27 states.
            Although the strike ultimately failed, it did raise awareness of the condition of employees and the need for stronger labor regulations. </p>

        <p>A law designating Labor Day as a national holiday was established by Congress in 1894.
            The goal of the holiday was to recognize employees' contributions and offer them a day off to commemorate their accomplishments.
            Labor Day has developed into a well-liked occasion for outdoor events like parades and picnics over the years.</p>
        
        <h3 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Labor Day honors the achievements made by American workers and the labor movement, which has aided in improving their quality of life.
            It's a good moment to think back on the achievements and the problems still at hand. Every year when we observe this occasion, we should be mindful of how crucial it is to defend the rights of workers and to support them.</p>
