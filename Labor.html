        <p>Every year, the first Monday in September is set aside as American Labor Day, a federal holiday. The holiday honors the labor movement's successes and
            efforts in the United States as well as the contributions of the workers who have helped to advance and better the country. Both reflection and celebration
            should be had on the value of labor in American culture. </p>

        <p>Labor Day originated in the late 19th century, when the American labor movement began to gain traction. Numerous employees at the time had to put up with poor working
            conditions, little pay, and lengthy workdays. In order to fight for better working conditions, labor unions were formed, and they began organizing strikes and protests
            to demand better treatment. </p>
        
        <h3 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">History</h3>
        <p>One of the pivotal moments in the history of the American labor movement was the Pullman Strike of 1894. Eugene V. Debs, the first president of the
            American Railway Union, oversaw the strike, which involved over 250,000 workers in 27 states. Despite the strike's eventual failure, it did bring attention
            to the poor state of workers and the need for tighter labor laws.

        </p>

        <p>In 1894, Congress passed a bill making Labor Day a federal holiday. The purpose of the holiday was to honor the contributions of the workers and give them a
            day off to celebrate their achievements. Over the years, Labor Day has become a popular day for outdoor activities including picnics and parades.</p>
        
        <h3 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Labor Day honors the achievements made by American workers and the labor movement, which has aided in improving their quality of life.
            It's a good moment to think back on the achievements and the problems still at hand. Every year when we observe this occasion, we should be mindful of how crucial it is to defend the rights of workers and to support them.</p>
