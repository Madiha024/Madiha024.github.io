                        Diwali (also called Divali or Deepavali) is a “festival of lights” that celebrates the triumph of light over dark
                        and good over evil, and the blessings of victory, freedom, and enlightenment. The festival is calculated by the lunar
                        Hindu calendar, it falls on different
                        days each year.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During the festival, Hindus, Jains and Sikhs illuminate their homes, temples and workspaces with diyas (oil lamps),
                        candles and lanterns. Hindus, in particular, have a ritual oil bath at dawn on each day of the festival.[20] Diwali
                        is also marked with fireworks and the decoration of floors with rangoli designs, and other parts of the house with jhalars.
                        Food is a major focus with families partaking in feasts and sharing sweets (mithai).
