        <p>The majority of the world's three largest economies—the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom—celebrate Halloween on October 31 every year.
            People like carving pumpkins, trick-or-treating, dressing up in costumes, and other frightening activities at this season. </p>

        <p>The secular festival of Halloween is observed in a variety of ways.
            Youngsters trick-or-treat by donning costumes, knocking on doors, and requesting sweets.
            In addition to dressing up and going to costume parties, many adults also decorate their homes with eerie accents like cobwebs, skeletons, and jack-o'-lanterns. </p>

        <p>The pumpkin is among Halloween's most well-known emblems.
            It's a common custom to carve pumpkins into jack-o-lanterns, and plenty of families like to go pumpkin picking to find the ideal pumpkin for their carving.
            Making pumpkin pie or other goodies with a pumpkin theme is something that some individuals like doing as well. </p>
