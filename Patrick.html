        <p>Every year on March 17, people across the world mark St. Patrick's Day, also known as the Feast of Saint Patrick, in honor of
            the patron saint of Ireland. It has been observed as a religious vacation in Ireland since the 17th century, and is celebrated
            not only in Ireland but also in numerous other countries across the world. One of the most popular traditions is the cortege,
            which was held in New York City in 1762 by Irish dog faces serving in the British army. Another well-known custom is eating
            and drinking traditional Irish food, such as soda bread, corned beef and cabbage, and Guinness beer. Green beer is served in
            some pubs and taverns to mark the anniversary, and the river in Chicago is dyed green. </p>
