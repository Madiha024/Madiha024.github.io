        <h2 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">What is St. Patricks Day and why is it celebrated?</h2>
        <p>The religious and cultural celebration known as St. Patrick's Day, or the Feast of Saint Patrick, is observed every year on March 17.
            It bears the name Saint Patrick in honor of the patron saint of Ireland, who is credited with converting the Irish to Christianity in the fifth century. </p>

        <p>Ireland has celebrated St. Patrick's Day as a religious holiday for more than a millennium.
            Yet, Ireland did not declare it a public holiday until the 17th century. St. Patrick's Day is now observed not just in Ireland but
            also in many other nations throughout the globe, especially in those with sizable Irish diaspora populations like the United States,
            Canada, and Australia. </p>

        <p>Green is a traditional St. Patrick's Day color since it is associated with Ireland and has come to represent Irish pride.
            Wearing green apparel and accessories, such as green hats, scarves, and shamrock-shaped pins, is a global tradition for St. Patrick's Day.
            To commemorate the occasion, numerous cityscapes and landmarks are lit in green. </p>

        <p>The parade is among the most well-liked St. Patrick's Day customs.
            Irish soldiers in the British army held the first St. Patrick's Day parade in New York City in 1762.
            In many places today, St. Patrick's Day parades are held, and they frequently include marching bands, dancers, and extravagant floats.
            New York City hosts the largest St. Patrick's Day parade, which annually draws over two million spectators.</p>

        <p>Another popular tradition is the consumption of traditional Irish food and drink. Corned beef and cabbage, Irish soda bread, and Guinness stout are
            all popular dishes associated with St. Patrick's Day. In some cities, pubs and bars serve green-colored beer to celebrate the occasion and Chicago dyes its river green.</p>
