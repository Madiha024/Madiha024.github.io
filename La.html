        <h2 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">What is La Tomatina and how is it celebrated?</h2>
        <p>A yearly celebration known as La Tomatina takes place in the Spanish town of Bu√±ol, close to Valencia.
            The largest tomato battle in history is a one-day celebration that happens on the final Wednesday of August. </p>

        <p>It is thought to have begun in the middle of the 20th century when a group of young people began hurling tomatoes at one another while watching a parade.
            The custom developed over time and is today a well-known tourist destination, bringing in thousands of visitors from all over the world. </p>

        <p>On the day of La Tomatina, trucks carrying ripe tomatoes reach the city, and people line the streets to take part in the festivities.
            The festival officially kicks up around 11 am, when there is a huge explosion, and tomato throwing starts.</p>

        <p>The participants then toss tomatoes at one another for the next hour, coating the streets and everyone nearby in a sea of bloody pulp.
            When a second loud explosion announces the festival's end and the local authorities have cleaned the streets, the tomato flinging stops. </p>
