        <h2 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">What is Kwanzaa and how is it celebrated?</h2>
        <p>Numerous African Americans celebrate Kwanzaa every year in the United States and other countries. In order to celebrate
            African culture and heritage and to encourage unity among African Americans, Dr. Maulana Karenga, a professor of African-American
            studies, formed it in 1966.
        </p>

        <p>Each day of the holiday, which lasts from December 26 to January 1, places emphasis on a different idea or value that is important
            to African culture. The tenets are referred to as the Nguzo Saba, which is Swahili for "seven principles". The seven guiding concepts
            of Kwanzaa are as follows:
        </p>

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>1. Umoja (Unity):</b> To work toward and uphold unity within the family, community, nation, and race.
        </p>

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>2. Kujichagulia (Self-Determination):</b> The ability to identify and name oneself as well as to think and act independently.

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>3. Ujima (Collective Work and Responsibility):</b> To develop and sustain our community as a whole as well as to take on and work to resolve the difficulties of our brothers' and sisters'.
        </p>

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>4. Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics):</b> To open our own enterprises, including shops and stores, and to share the profits we make from them.

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>5. Nia (Purpose):</b> To make the growth and development of our community our shared purpose in order to bring our people back to their former brilliance.
        </p>

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>6. Kuumba (Creativity):</b> Always strive to leave our community in a better state than when we found it.
        </p>

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>7. Imani (Faith):</b> To fully trust in our nation, our parents, our instructors, our leaders, and the justice and success of our fight.
        </p>

        <p>On a unique candleholder known as a Kinara, a candle is lit each day of Kwanzaa. Each of the seven candles in the Kinara stands for a
            different Kwanzaa value. The candles are made of the same colors as the African liberation flag: red, green, and black.
        </p>

        <p>A black candle is lit on December 26th, the first day of Kwanzaa, to symbolize Umoja. A crimson candle and a black candle are lit on the second day to
            symbolize Kujichagulia. To symbolize Ujima, a black candle, a red candle, a green candle, and so on are lit beginning on the third day.</p>
