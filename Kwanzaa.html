        <h2 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">What is Kwanzaa and how is it celebrated?</h2>
        <p>Many African Americans in the United States and other countries across the world celebrate Kwanzaa every year.
            It was established in 1966 as a method to respect African culture and legacy and to foster unity among African Americans by Dr. Maulana Karenga, a professor of African-American studies. </p>

        <p>Kwanzaa is celebrated from December 26th to January 1st, and each day of the celebration focuses on a different principle or value that is
            important in African culture. The principles are called the Nguzo Saba, which means "seven principles" in Swahili. The seven principles of
            Kwanzaa are:</p>

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>1. Umoja (Unity):</b> To strive for and maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race.
        </p>

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>2. Kujichagulia (Self-Determination):</b> To define and name ourselves, as well as to create and speak for ourselves.
        </p>

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>3. Ujima (Collective Work and Responsibility):</b> To build and maintain our community together and to make our brothers'
            and sisters' problems our problems and to solve them together.
        </p>

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>4. Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics):</b> To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together.
        </p>

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>5. Nia (Purpose):</b> To make our collective vocation the building and developing of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness.
        </p>

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>6. Kuumba (Creativity):</b> To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it.
        </p>

        <p style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">
            <b>7. Imani (Faith):</b> To believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.
        </p>

        <p>Each day of Kwanzaa, a candle is lit on a special candleholder called a Kinara. The Kinara holds seven candles, each representing one of the principles of Kwanzaa. The candles are red,
            green, and black, which are the colors of the African liberation flag.</p>

        <p>On the first day of Kwanzaa, December 26th, a black candle is lit to represent Umoja. On the second day, a black candle and a red candle are lit to represent Kujichagulia. On the third day,
            a black candle, a red candle, and a green candle are lit to represent Ujima, and so on, until all seven candles are lit on the seventh day, January 1st.</p>
