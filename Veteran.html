        <p>Veterans Day is a yearly celebration observed on November 11 in the United States. It is a day set aside to thank and commemorate the men
            and women who have served in the US military. The holiday, which was first known as Armistice Day, was instituted on November 11th, 1919,
            to mark the conclusion of World War I.</p>

        <p>On this day, Americans pay tribute to the brave men and women who have sacrificed so much of themselves to protect their country. Veterans
            Day serves as an occasion to recognize the bravery and sacrifice of the many millions of Americans who have served in the military and to show
            appreciation for their services. This day has been set aside to honor the Marines, soldiers, sailors, and airmen who have defended democracy
            and fought for freedom.</p>

        <p>Veterans Day is observed in many different ways across the country. Many cities and towns hold parades to honor veterans, and schools
            often organize programs and events to teach children about the importance of Veterans Day. Businesses and restaurants often offer special
            deals and discounts to veterans as a way to say thank you for their service.</p>
