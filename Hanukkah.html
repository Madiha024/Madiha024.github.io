        <p>Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah to remember the Second Temple's rededication in Jerusalem in the second century BCE.
            The eight-day, nine-night holiday usually falls in late November or early December. </p>
        
        <h3 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">History</h3>
        <p>The Maccabees were a band of Jewish insurgents who opposed the Seleucid Empire, which had taken control of Judea and was imposing its Hellenistic culture on the Jewish people. This is when Hanukkah first appeared.
            Once the Seleucids had desecrated the Temple, the Maccabees were eventually able to regain Jerusalem. </p>

        <p>The menorah, an eight-branched candelabrum, was only lit for one day when the Maccabees entered the Temple, according to legend.
            The oil, however, surprisingly survived for eight days until more oil could be produced.
            Each night of the celebration, a Hanukkiah, a special nine-branched menorah, is lit to commemorate this occasion. </p>
        
        <h3 style = "color: rgb(132, 35, 35);">How it's celebrated?</h3>
        <p>There are various customs related to Hanukkah besides lighting the Hanukkiah.
            Families get together to eat customary dishes like sufganiyot and latkes, a four-sided spinning top that is popular among children (jelly-filled doughnuts).
            Even while gift-exchanging is not a traditional element of the holiday, some families nevertheless do it.</p>
