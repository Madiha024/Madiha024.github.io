        <p>Every year in March, there is a celebration called Women's History Month to honor the efforts and accomplishments of women throughout
            history. When Congress proclaimed March to be National Women's History Month in the United States in 1987, the celebration officially
            got underway. Since then, it has spread to other nations all over the globe.</p>

        <p>Women's groups started commemorating International Women's Day on March 8 in the early 1900s, which is when Women's History Month got
            its start. This day was selected to honor the 1908 New York City garment workers' strike, during which women called for improved working
            conditions and higher pay. The Sonoma County (California) Commission on the Status of Women's Education Task Force established Women's
            History Week in 1978 to correspond with International Women's Day. As the concept gathered traction, President Jimmy Carter issued the
            first Presidential Proclamation designating the week of March 8-14 as National Women's History Week in 1980. Congress extended the holiday
            to include the full month of March in 1987.</p>
