        <p>Every March, a celebration known as Women's History Month is celebrated to honor the accomplishments and contributions of women throughout
            history. When Congress proclaimed March to be National Women's History Month in the United States, the commemoration officially got under
            way. It has since expanded to countless other nations throughout the world.
        </p>

        <p>In the early 1900s, women's organizations started observing March 8 as International Women's Day, which led to the creation of Women's History
            Month. It was inspired by the 1908 New York City garment workers' strike, during which women fought for better pay and working conditions. Women's
            History Week was started in 1978 to coincide with International Women's Day by the Sonoma County Commission on the Status of Women's Education Task
            Force. As the concept gained popularity, Congress extended the holiday to include the full month of March in 1987. President Jimmy Carter first
            declared the week of March 8-14 as National Women's History Week in 1980.</p>
